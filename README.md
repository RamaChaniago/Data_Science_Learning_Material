This is GitHub repository for all data science materials I feel are important. All the materials are categorized by the contents. 
Feel free to pull and fork the material for your learning!

I am also writing a lot about data science, you can visit the article on my other [Notion]([https://github.com/cornelliusyudhawijaya/Data-Science-Article](https://cornellius.notion.site/Cornellius-Data-Article-List-28b0b670da6b4d158acb58902f2fef2d)).

If you feel the material is helpful to you, maybe **bought me a cup of coffee?** Thank you!
